# Computational Platforms Comparison

Contact: Simon Worthington, [@mrchristian GITHUB](https://github.com/mrchristian). NFDI4Culture, @OSL_TIB.

Connecting computational publishing to conventional publishing pipelines - in this case the ADA Semantic Publishing Pipeline.

## Use case

Proof of concept publication on a computational publishing platform.

Motivation: Can 'computational publishing platform' act as a authoring and querying tools for LOD sources. Most cultural digital databases are presented in the mode of a database engineering - can the platforms act as story telling (presentation) layers directly drawing from and connected to the LOD sources.

Presentation of CdBB content based on LOD work by NFDI4Culture @Team_TIB __['Semantic annotation for 3D cultural artefacts'](https://wikibase.wbworkshop.tibwiki.io/wiki/Main_Page)__ MVP content: Baroque ceiling painting and frescos Germany from the existing _[barocken Deckenmalerei in Deutschland (CbDD)](https://deckenmalerei.badw.de/das-projekt.html)_ collection.

## Questions

  - What computational platforms work for publishers?

  - What's interesting for readers in computational publishing platform?

  - Road testing platforms: using digital objects; peforming LOD queries and visualisation; usability, suiablity for publishers, readers, and authors?

## About the ADA Publishing Pipeline

  The pipeline is an open source project for the automation of publishing. It connects the word processor to directly to the publish workflow using single source publishing technology and methods.

  The pipeline connects [Fidus Writer](https://www.fiduswriter.org/) an online word processor with GitLab or GitHub for versioned storage and uses [Vivliosyle](https://vivliostyle.org/) for CSS Typesetting. The pipeline project is based on open source work of [ADA Semantic Publishing Pipeline](https://github.com/NFDI4Culture/ADA-semantic-publishing) from the Open Science Lab, TIB (Hannover).

  All software used with the exception of GitHub is open source.
